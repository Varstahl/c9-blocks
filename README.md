## C9 WordPress Theme
To build your own themes with our Bootstrap and CSS Grid based responsive blocks plugin, we've set up a starter theme that utilizes most of Bootstrap's componennts, and works seamlessly with the new custom editor style from WordPress 5. If you're at the 'logo and an address' phase of your website, this theme is a great starting point.

If you're working on behalf of a client or customer, then the theme has a client boilerplate folder, and has full child theme support should you want to build your own style guide and themes on top of our starter theme. The starter theme is based on Understrap(https://understrap.com/), but with a more modern approach to using Gutenberg's editing system.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can C9 Blocks be used with any theme?**

The current blocks plugin supports the WordPress Twenty Nineteen, upcoming WordPress Twenty Twenty Beta Theme, as well as the C9 Starter Theme. We're working to make the plugin work with other themes as well, and if you have a page template that supports full-width layouts, then the C9 Blocks plugin should work with most Bootstrap and some non-Bootstrap themes.

**Do I need the new block editor to use C9 Blocks?**

Yes, you will need to have WordPress 5.0 or later installed to take advantage of C9 Blocks, and if you have the latest versin of the Gutenberg plugin installed, you can use the BlockPreview support we have built into our saved templates modal, but there may be some conflicts that exist as we haven't fully tested the latest Gutenberg plugin editor with our theme/plugin.
